## 3.4.0

### Dependencies

- **Google Generative AI SDK** — Replaced
  `google_cloud_ai_generativelanguage_v1beta` with
  [`googleai_dart`](https://pub.dev/packages/googleai_dart) ^5.0.1
  ([#107](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/pull/107)). Chat, embeddings, and
  media generation now use this client; user-facing Dartantic APIs are unchanged
  aside from new options below.

### Added

- **Google (Gemini) — thinking levels** — `GoogleChatModelOptions.thinkingLevel`
  (`GoogleThinkingLevel`: minimal, low, medium, high) for Gemini 3+ models that
  support thinking depth. Do not combine with `thinkingBudgetTokens`; the API
  rejects both. ([#108](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/pull/108))
- **Google (Gemini) — File Search** — `GoogleChatModelOptions.fileSearch` with
  `GoogleFileSearchToolConfig` (file search store names, optional `topK` and
  `metadataFilter`) for semantic retrieval from configured stores.
  ([#108](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/pull/108))
- **Google (Gemini) — Maps grounding** — `GoogleChatModelOptions.mapsGrounding`
  with `GoogleMapsGroundingOptions` (optional `enableWidget` for widget context
  in grounding metadata when supported).
  ([#108](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/pull/108))
- **Google (Gemini) — grounding metadata** — Model messages from Gemini can
  include `grounding_metadata` in message metadata (JSON from the API’s
  grounding metadata), including for Maps when enabled.
  ([#108](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/pull/108))
- **xAI Responses — `max_turns`** — `XAIResponsesChatModelOptions.maxTurns`
  maps to the API’s `max_turns` (cap on assistant / server-side tool iterations
  per request). See xAI’s tool documentation for interaction with client- vs
  server-side tools. ([#106](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/pull/106))

## 3.3.0

### Dependencies

- **`dartantic_interface` ^4.0.0** — adds `ModelKind.video` for video generation in
  model discovery. Exhaustive `switch`es on `ModelKind` must handle `video` or use
  a `default` branch (see the `dartantic_interface` changelog).

### Added

- **Google (Gemini) — URL Context server-side tool** — `GoogleServerSideTool.urlContext`
  in `GoogleChatModelOptions.serverSideTools` enables Gemini URL context so the
  model can retrieve and use content from allowed URLs. 
- **xAI (Grok)** — `xai` provider (alias `grok`) using the OpenAI-compatible chat
  completions API at `https://api.x.ai/v1`, API key `XAI_API_KEY`. Chat, vision,
  tools, streaming, and typed output; embeddings and `temperature` are not
  supported in Dartantic for this provider.
- **xAI Responses** — `xai-responses` provider (alias `grok-responses`) using
  xAI’s Responses API with the same base URL and `XAI_API_KEY`. Supports
  thinking, server-side tools (web search, X search, file search, code
  interpreter, MCP), and native xAI image/video media generation with defaults
  `grok-imagine-image` / `grok-imagine-video`.

### Documentation

- Provider and quick-start docs (including xAI), environment setup, README
  cross-links, and related wiki/docs site updates.

## 3.2.0

### SDK Dependency Upgrades

Migrated all provider SDK dependencies to their latest major versions:

| Dependency                                  | Before | After |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| `anthropic_sdk_dart`                        | 0.3.x  | 1.2.0 |
| `mistralai_dart`                            | 0.1.x  | 1.2.0 |
| `ollama_dart`                               | 0.3.x  | 1.2.0 |
| `openai_dart`                               | 0.6.x  | 1.1.0 |
| `google_cloud_ai_generativelanguage_v1beta` | 0.4.0  | 0.5.0 |

### Breaking Changes

- **Google Embeddings Model**: Default embeddings model changed from
  `text-embedding-004` to `gemini-embedding-001`. The old model was removed
  from Google's v1beta API.

## 3.1.0

### Fixed: Google Server-Side Tools with Structured Output

Fixed issue [#96](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/issues/96) where combining
Google server-side tools (Google Search, Code Execution) with typed output would
fail with "Tool use with a response mime type: 'application/json' is
unsupported".

Server-side tools now work with typed output using the same two-phase
`GoogleDoubleAgentOrchestrator` approach as user-defined tools:

- **Phase 1**: Execute server-side tools (no outputSchema)
- **Phase 2**: Get structured JSON output (no tools)

```dart
// Now works! Previously failed with API error
final agent = Agent(
  'google',
  chatModelOptions: const GoogleChatModelOptions(
    serverSideTools: {GoogleServerSideTool.googleSearch},
  ),
);

final result = await agent.sendFor<MyOutput>(
  'Search for current weather and return as JSON',
  outputSchema: MyOutput.schema,
  outputFromJson: MyOutput.fromJson,
);
```

The fix automatically detects server-side tools and selects the appropriate
orchestrator, with no code changes required for existing applications.

## 3.0.0

### Streaming Thinking via `chunk.thinking`

Added a dedicated `thinking` field to `ChatResult<String>` for streaming
thinking content. This provides symmetric access to thinking during streaming,
matching how `chunk.output` provides streaming text:

```dart
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream(prompt)) {
  if (chunk.thinking != null) {
    stdout.write(chunk.thinking);  // Real-time thinking display
  }
  stdout.write(chunk.output);  // Real-time text display
  history.addAll(chunk.messages);  // Consolidated messages
}
```

This is an additive change - the final consolidated message still contains
`ThinkingPart` for history storage.

### Breaking Change: Migrated to genai_primitives Types

The core message types have been migrated from custom implementations to the
standardized `genai_primitives` package. This provides better interoperability
with other GenAI tooling in the Dart ecosystem.

Types now re-exported from `genai_primitives`:

- `ChatMessage`, `ChatMessageRole`
- `Part` (alias for `StandardPart`), `TextPart`, `DataPart`, `LinkPart`,
  `ThinkingPart`
- `ToolPart`, `ToolPartKind`
- `ToolDefinition`

Note: `Part` is a typedef alias for `StandardPart` from genai_primitives 0.2.0.
See dartantic_interface CHANGELOG for details on custom Part implementations.

### Breaking Change: Migrated to json_schema_builder for Schemas

The `Schema` type is now provided by the `json_schema_builder` package instead
of a custom implementation. This provides a more robust JSON Schema builder with
better validation.

```dart
// NEW: Use S.object() for empty schemas, S.* for building schemas
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';

final tool = Tool(
  name: 'my_tool',
  description: 'Does something',
  inputSchema: S.object(properties: {
    'name': S.string(description: 'The name'),
  }),
  onCall: (args) => 'Hello ${args['name']}',
);
```

### Thinking API

Extended thinking (chain-of-thought reasoning) is accessed via
`ChatResult.thinking` for both streaming and non-streaming:

```dart
final agent = Agent('anthropic', enableThinking: true);

// Non-streaming
final result = await agent.send('Solve this puzzle...');
print(result.thinking);

// Streaming
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream('Solve this puzzle...')) {
  if (chunk.thinking != null) stdout.write(chunk.thinking);  // Real-time
}
```

Thinking is also stored as `ThinkingPart` in message parts for conversation
history.

### Provider Changes

- **Mistral Default Model**: Changed default from `mistral-small-latest` to
  `mistral-medium-latest` for more reliable tool calling. The small model was
  truncating string arguments in certain scenarios.

### Fixes

- **Anthropic Thinking Metadata**: The thinking signature is still stored in
  metadata while the thinking text is only stored in `ThinkingPart`.

- **ThinkingPart Filtering**: Each provider's message mapper now correctly
  handles `ThinkingPart` - Anthropic converts it to thinking blocks for the API,
  while other providers filter it out during mapping since they don't need
  thinking content sent back.

## 2.2.3

- moved Agent method input params to take Iterable instead of List per
  [@d-markey's PR](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/pull/90). Thank you,
  David!
- Fixed duplicate file downloads in Anthropic media generation. The media gen
  model now delegates file downloading to the chat model's built-in
  auto-download functionality, matching the pattern used by Google and OpenAI
  providers.

## 2.2.2

- Updated mcp_dart dependency to 1.2.1 to fix a null issue.

## 2.2.1

- **Gemini 3 Tool Calling Fix**: Fixed "Function call is missing a
  thought_signature" error when using tools with Gemini 3 models like
  `gemini-3-flash-preview`. No code changes required - just upgrade and it
  works. ([#85](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/issues/85)). Thanks to
  @ElectricCookie for [the PR](https://github.com/csells/dartantic/pull/86)!

## 2.2.0

- **Mistral Tool Calling Support**: Enhanced Mistral provider with robust tool
  calling capabilities:
  - Updated `mistralai_dart` dependency to 0.1.1+1 which fixes streaming tool
    call issues
  - Improved message mappers with null-safe tool call handling
  - Added filtering for incomplete tool calls in streaming responses
  - Enabled `multiToolCalls` capability for Mistral provider
  - Updated tests to verify tool calling works correctly with streaming
- **Enhanced Cohere & Ollama Capabilities**: Both providers now support
  `multiToolCalls` capability for parallel tool execution
- Added OCR (Optical Character Recognition) example to `multimedia_input.dart`
  demonstrating text extraction from images using Gemini's vision capabilities

## 2.1.1

- Added custom dimensions support for Mistral embeddings:
  - `MistralEmbeddingsModel` now passes `outputDimension` and `encodingFormat`
    parameters to the Mistral API
  - Leverages `outputDimension` parameter added in `mistralai_dart` PR #886
  - Updated tests to use `codestral-embed-2505` for custom dimensions testing
    (default `mistral-embed` model doesn't support custom dimensions)
- Updated default Mistral chat model from `open-mistral-7b` to
  `mistral-small-latest` for better overall capabilities

## 2.1.0

- Added image editing support to media generation across all providers
  - Fixed `GoogleMediaGenerationModel` to accept attachments with image requests
  - Attachments (DataPart, LinkPart, TextPart) are now properly converted to
    Google API format (inlineData, fileData, text)
  - Enables image editing use cases: colorization, style transfer, inpainting
  - Added e2e tests for image editing with attachments for Google, OpenAI, and
    Anthropic providers
  - Updated all media generation examples to include image editing
    demonstrations
  - Refactored Google Part mapping to use shared `mapPartsToGoogle()` helper
- Refactored provider `listModels()` implementations to use SDK methods instead
  of raw HTTP:
  - Anthropic: Uses `client.listModels()` from `anthropic_sdk_dart`
  - Ollama: Uses `client.listModels()` from `ollama_dart`
  - Mistral: Uses `client.listModels()` from `mistralai_dart`
- Removed Anthropic `signature_delta` work-around (fixed in `anthropic_sdk_dart`
  0.3.1)

## 2.0.3

- Updated Anthropic SDK compatibility for `anthropic_sdk_dart` 0.3.1:
  - `ImageBlockSource` now uses sealed class API with `base64ImageSource()`
    factory
  - Added support for new block types: `DocumentBlock`, `RedactedThinkingBlock`,
    `ServerToolUseBlock`, `WebSearchToolResultBlock`, `MCPToolUseBlock`
  - Added support for new delta types: `SignatureBlockDelta`,
    `CitationsBlockDelta`
  - Added `pauseTurn` and `refusal` stop reasons
- Updated Mistral SDK compatibility for `mistralai_dart` 0.1.1:
  - Fixed ambiguous imports for `JsonSchema` and `Tool`
  - Added `error` and `toolCalls` finish reasons

## 2.0.2

- updated dependencies

## 2.0.1

- updated dependencies

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Change: Exposing dartantic_interface directly from dartantic_ai

It's no longer necessary to manually include the dartantic_interface package.

```dart
// OLD - had to import both packages
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';
import 'package:dartantic_interface/dartantic_interface.dart';

// NEW - one import does it all
import 'package:dartantic_ai/dartantic_ai.dart';
```

### Breaking Change: Provider Factory Registry

Provider lookup has been moved from the `Providers` class to `Agent` static
methods. Providers are now created via factory functions not cached instances.

```dart
// OLD
final provider = Providers.get('openai');
final allProviders = Providers.all;
Providers.providerMap['custom'] = MyProvider();
final provider2 = Providers.openai;

// NEW
final provider = Agent.getProvider('openai');
final allProviders = Agent.allProviders;
Agent.providerFactories['custom'] = MyProvider.new;
final provider2 = OpenAIProvider();
```

### Breaking Change: Moved OpenAI-compat providers to example (except OpenRouter)

Removed the following intrinsic providers from dartantic to the
`openai_compat.dart` example:

- `google-openai`
- `together`
- `ollama-openai`

The `openrouter` OpenAI-compatible provider remains as an intrinsic provider.

### Breaking Changes: Simplified Thinking API

Extended thinking (chain-of-thought reasoning) is now a first-class feature in
Dartantic with a simplified, unified API across all providers that support
thinking:

```dart
// OLD
final agent = Agent(
  'openai-responses:gpt5',
  chatModelOptions: OpenAIResponsesChatModelOptions(
    reasoningSummary: OpenAIReasoningSummary.detailed,
  ),
);
final thinking = result.metadata['thinking'] as String?;

// NEW
final agent = Agent('openai-responses:gpt5', enableThinking: true);
final thinking = result.thinking;
```

- Provider-specific fine-tuning options remain for advanced use cases:
  - `GoogleChatModelOptions.thinkingBudgetTokens`
  - `AnthropicChatOptions.thinkingBudgetTokens`
  - `OpenAIResponsesChatModelOptions.reasoningSummary`

### Breaking Change: Removed `ProviderCaps`

The `ProviderCaps` type was removed from the provider implementation and moved
to a helper function in the tests.

```dart
// OLD
final visionProviders = Providers.allWith({ProviderCaps.chatVision});

// NEW
// use Provider.listModels() and choose via ModelInfo instead
```

### New: Custom Headers for Enterprise

All providers now support custom HTTP headers for enterprise scenarios like
authentication proxies, request tracing, or compliance logging:

```dart
final provider = GoogleProvider(
  apiKey: apiKey,
  headers: {
    'X-Request-ID': requestId,
    'X-Tenant-ID': tenantId,
  },
);
```

### Updated: Google Native JSON Schema Support

Google's Gemini API now uses native JSON Schema support for both:

- **Typed output** via `responseJsonSchema` - for structured responses
- **Tool parameters** via `parametersJsonSchema` - for function calling

This replaces the previous custom `Schema` object conversion, enabling better
support for complex schemas including `anyOf`, `$ref`, and other JSON Schema
features that were previously rejected.

This is an internal change with no API surface changes for you except that now
you can pass more complex JSON schemas to Google models for both typed output
and tool definitions.

### New: Google Function Calling Mode

Added `functionCallingMode` and `allowedFunctionNames` options to
`GoogleChatModelOptions` for controlling tool/function calling behavior:

```dart
final agent = Agent(
  'google',
  chatModelOptions: GoogleChatModelOptions(
    functionCallingMode: GoogleFunctionCallingMode.any, // Force tool calls
    allowedFunctionNames: ['get_weather'], // Limit to specific functions
  ),
);
```

Available modes:

- `auto` (default): Model decides when to call functions
- `any`: Model always calls a function
- `none`: Model never calls functions
- `validated`: Like auto but validates calls with constrained decoding

### New Model Type: Media Generation

```dart
final agent = Agent('google');

// Image generation - uses Nano Banana by default (gemini-2.5-flash-image)
final imageResult = await agent.generateMedia(
  'Create a minimalist robot mascot for a developer conference.',
  mimeTypes: const ['image/png'],
);

// Or specify the model explicitly (like Nano Banana Pro)
final agent = Agent('google?media=gemini-3-pro-image-preview');
```

- Added media generation APIs to `Agent` (`generateMedia` and
  `generateMediaStream`) with streaming aggregation helpers.

- Added media generation support for the `OpenAIResponsesProvider`,
  `GoogleProvider` and `AnthropicProvider` implementations `createMediaModel`.
  All three of them support generating media with a prompt and a mime type,
  using a combination of their intrinsic image generation and their server-side
  code execution environments to generate files of all types.

- Extended `ModelStringParser` with `media=` selectors and added media-specific
  defaults in the provider registry.

Check out the new media-gen examples to see them in action.

### New: Server-Side Tools Across Providers

Server-side tools are now supported across multiple providers:

| Provider             | Tools Available                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI Responses** | Web Search, File Search, Image Generation, Code Interpreter |
| **Google**           | Google Search (Grounding), Code Execution                   |
| **Anthropic**        | Web Search, Web Fetch, Code Interpreter                     |

```dart
// Google server-side tools
final agent = Agent(
  'google',
  chatModelOptions: const GoogleChatModelOptions(
    serverSideTools: {GoogleServerSideTool.googleSearch},
  ),
);

// Anthropic server-side tools
final agent = Agent(
  'anthropic',
  chatModelOptions: const AnthropicChatOptions(
    serverSideTools: {AnthropicServerSideTool.webSearch},
  ),
);
```

You can see how they all work in the new set of server-side tooling examples.

## 1.3.0

- **Anthropic Extended Thinking Support**: Added support for Anthropic's
  extended thinking (chain-of-thought reasoning) exposed in the same way as the
  OpenAI Responses provider does, so you can write your code to look for
  thinking output regardless of the provider.
- **Ollama Typed Output Support**: Ollama now supports JSON schema natively
  through the updated `ollama_dart` package.
- **Mistral Usage Tracking**: The updated `mistralai_dart` package now includes
  the usage field natively in `ChatCompletionStreamResponse`, providing accurate
  token counts for prompt, response, and totals.
- **Cohere Multi-Tool Calling Disabled**: Removed `ProviderCaps.multiToolCalls`
  from Cohere due to a bug in their OpenAI-compatible API wrt to toolcall IDs.

## 1.2.0

Another big release!

- Migrated Google provider from deprecated `google_generative_ai` to generated
  `google_cloud_ai_generativelanguage_v1beta` package. This is an internal
  implementation change with no API surface changes for users. However, it does
  fix some response formatting issues the deprecated package was having as the
  underlying API changed; it's so nice to be using the Google-supported package
  again!
- Internal chat orchestration rearchitecture to simplify Agent and chat model
  implementations and to focus per-provider orchestration on individual
  providers.
  - Added Anthropic orchestration provider to handle the toolcall-based method
    of typed output it requires.
  - Added Google "double agent" orchestrator to support typed output with tools
    simultaneously. Google's API doesn't support tools and `outputSchema` in a
    single call, so the orchestrator transparently executes a two-phase
    workflow: Phase 1 executes tools, Phase 2 requests structured output. This
    makes Google functionally equivalent to OpenAI and Anthropic for typed
    output + tools use cases.
- Restored support for the web! A rogue AI coding agent wrote docs that pulled
  in `dart:io`, disabling web support. dartantic_ai fully supports the web and
  if it ever says it doesn't, that's a bug.
- Used the updated `openai_core` package to refactor `OpenAIResponsesChatModel`
  to eliminate workaround for retrieving container file names.
- Updated the default Anthropic model to `claude-sonnet-4-0`, although of course
  you can use whichever model you want.
- Fixed the `homepage` tag in the `pubspec.yaml`.
- Added [llms.txt](https://docs.dartantic.ai/llms.txt) and
  [llms-full.txt](https://docs.dartantic.ai/llms-full.txt) for LLM readers.

## 1.1.0

This is a big release!

- Added the OpenAI Responses provider built on `openai_core`, including session
  persistence (aka prompt caching), intrinsic server-side tools, and thinking
  metadata streams. Thanks to @jezell for his most excellent `openai_core`
  package and his quick turn-around on my blocking issues!
  - Streaming thinking and server-side tool call progress
  - Server-side image generation with quality, size and partial progress as well
    as generated image returned as part for ease of access
  - Server-side web search with full progress reports
  - Server-side code interpreter with reusable containers and returning of
    generated files of all types as parts for ease of access
  - Full server-side vector search tool with example showing how to upload files
    and query vectors
  - GPT-5 Codex access!
- Replaced the Lambda provider with the new `openai_compat.dart` sample
- Filtered Cohere models to "Live" entries and updated the default chat model
- Surface usage totals for every provider consistently
- Added support for the `DARTANTIC_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable for one-line
  logging configuration
- Support for the fully
  [spec](https://google.github.io/dotprompt/implementors/)-compliant
  [dotprompt_dart package](https://pub.dev/packages/dotprompt_dart)
- Published all of the specs for dartantic in a new Specifications section in
  the docs
- 1300+ tests to ensure feature compatibility across the set of supported LLMs

## 1.0.8

- fix a intermittent anthropic tool-calling error with streaming responses
- fix an openai-based tool-calling error that resulted in an infinite loop from
  empty responses after tool calls

## 1.0.7

- move from soti_schema to soti_schema_plus in examples, as the former seems to
  have been abandoned
- fixed: can't move to the latest version of freezed etc due to deps in
  ollama_dart [#54](https://github.com/csells/dartantic_ai/issues/54)
- fixed: apiKey and baseUrl parameters should be exposed from the OllamaProvider
  [#52](https://github.com/csells/dartantic_ai/issues/52)
- fixed: Dartantic AI package local dependency
  [#53](https://github.com/csells/dartantic_ai/issues/53)
- fixed: update for openai_dart 0.5.4
  [#51](https://github.com/csells/dartantic_ai/issues/51)
- fixed chatarang to use new streaming message collection pattern

## 1.0.6

- Fixed #48: Pass package name and other info to Generative AI providers. I
  added an example of how to use a custom HTTP client for these kinds of things
  when creating a model. It's not as easy as it could be, and it didn't work for
  gemini w/o a quick fix, but it's doable.

## 1.0.5

- Fixed #47: Dartantic is checking for wrong environment variable. I was being
  aggressive about constructing providers before they were used and checking API
  keys before they were needed, which was causing this issue. For example, if
  you wanted to use `Agent('google')` and didn't have the MISTRAL_API_KEY set
  (why would you?), string lookup creates all of the providers, which caused all
  of them to check for their API key and -- BOOM.

## 1.0.4

- Updated LLM SDK dependencies:
  - `anthropic_sdk_dart`: 0.2.1 → 0.2.2
  - `openai_dart`: 0.5.2 → 0.5.3 (adds nullable choices field support for Groq
    compatibility)
  - `mistralai_dart`: 0.0.4 → 0.0.5
  - `ollama_dart`: 0.2.3 → 0.2.4

## 1.0.3

- Fixed quickstart example code and updated README

## 1.0.2

- fixed a compilation error on the web

## 1.0.1

- updating to dartantic_interface 1.0.1 (that didn't take long : )

## 1.0.0

### Dynamic => Static Provider factories

Provider access has moved to `Agent` static methods:

```dart
// OLD (0.9.x)
final provider = OpenAiProvider();
final providerFactory = Agent.providers['google'];
final providerFactoryByAlias = Agent.providers['gemini'];

// NEW (2.0.0)
final provider1 = Agent.createProvider('openai');
final provider2 = Agent.createProvider('google');
final provider3 = Agent.createProvider('gemini');
```

If you'd like to extend the list of providers dynamically at runtime, you can
use the `providerFactories` map on the `Agent` class:

```dart
Agent.providerFactories['my-provider'] = MyProvider.new;
```

### Agent.runXxx => Agent.sendXxx

The `Agent.runXxx` methods have been renamed for consistency with chat models
and the new `Chat` class:

```dart
// OLD
final result = await agent.run('Hello');
final typedResult = await agent.runFor<T>('Hello', outputSchema: schema);
await for (final chunk in agent.runStream('Hello')) {...}

// NEW
final result = await agent.send('Hello');
final typedResult = await agent.sendFor<T>('Hello', outputSchema: schema);
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream('Hello')) {...}
```

Also, when you're sending a prompt to the agent, instead of passing a list of
messages via the messages parameter, you can pass it via the history parameter:

```dart
// OLD
final result = await agent.run('Hello', messages: messages);

// NEW
final result = await agent.send('Hello', history: history);
```

The subtle difference is that the history is a list of previous messages before
the prompt + optional attachments, which forms the new message. Love it or
don't, but it made sense to me at the time...

### Agent.provider => Agent.forProvider

The `Agent.provider` constructor has been renamed to `Agent.forProvider` for
clarity:

```dart
// OLD
final agent = Agent.provider(OpenAiProvider());

// NEW
final agent = Agent.forProvider(Agent.createProvider('anthropic'));
```

### Message => ChatMessage

The `Message` type has been renamed to `ChatMessage` for consistency with chat
models:

```dart
// OLD
var messages = <Message>[];
final response = await agent.run('Hello', messages: messages);
messages = response.messages.toList();

// NEW
var history = <ChatMessage>[];
final response = await agent.send('Hello', history: history);
history.addAll(response.messages);
```

### toSchema => JsonSchema.create

The `toSchema` method has been dropped in favor of the built-in
`JsonSchema.create` method for simplicity:

```dart
// OLD
final schema = <String, dynamic>{
  'type': 'object',
  'properties': {
    'town': {'type': 'string'},
    'country': {'type': 'string'},
  },
  'required': ['town', 'country'],
}.toSchema();

// NEW
final schema = JsonSchema.create({
  'type': 'object',
  'properties': {
    'town': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Name of the town'},
    'country': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Name of the country'},
  },
  'required': ['town', 'country'],
});
```

### systemPrompt + Message.system() => ChatMessage.system()

The `systemPrompt` parameter has been removed from Agent and model constructors.
It was confusing to have both a system prompt and a system message, so I've
simplified the implementation to use just an optional `ChatMessage.system()`
instead. In practice, you'll want to keep the system message in the history
anyway, so think of this as a "pit of success" thing:

```dart
// OLD
final agent = Agent(
  'openai',
  systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
);
final result = await agent.send('Hello');

// NEW
final agent = Agent('openai');
final result = await agent.send(
  'Hello',
  history: [
    const ChatMessage.system('You are a helpful assistant.'),
  ],
);
```

### Agent chat and streaming

The agent now streams new messages as they're created along with the output:

```dart
final agent = Agent('openai');
final history = <ChatMessage>[];
await for (final chunk in agent.sendStream('Hello', history: history)) {
  // collect text and messages as they're created
  print(chunk.output);
  history.addAll(chunk.messages);
}
```

If you'd prefer not to collect and track the message history manually, you can
use the `Chat` class to collect messages for you:

```dart
final chat = Chat(Agent('openai'));
await for (final chunk in chat.sendStream('Hello')) {
  print(chunk.output);
}

// chat.history is a list of ChatMessage objects
```

### DataPart.file(File) => DataPart.fromFile(XFile)

The `DataPart.file` constructor has been replaced with `DataPart.fromFile` to
support cross-platform file handling, i.e. the web:

```dart
// OLD
import 'dart:io';

final part = await DataPart.file(File('bio.txt'));

// NEW
import 'package:cross_file/cross_file.dart';

final file = XFile.fromData(
  await File('bio.txt').readAsBytes(),
  path: 'bio.txt',
);
final part = await DataPart.fromFile(file);
```

### Model String Format Enhanced

The model string format has been enhanced to support chat, embeddings and other
model names using custom relative URI. This was important to be able to specify
the model for chat and embeddings separately:

```dart
// OLD
Agent('openai');
Agent('openai:gpt-4o');
Agent('openai/gpt-4o');

// NEW - all of the above still work plus:
Agent('openai?chat=gpt-4o&embeddings=text-embedding-3-large');
```

### Agent.embedXxx

The agent gets new `Agent.embedXxx` methods for creating embeddings for
documents and queries:

```dart
final agent = Agent('openai');
final embedding = await agent.embedQuery('Hello world');
final results = await agent.embedDocuments(['Text 1', 'Text 2']);
final similarity = EmbeddingsModel.cosineSimilarity(e1, e2);
```

Also, the `cosineSimilarity` method has been moved to the `EmbeddingsModel`.

### Automatic Retry

The agent now supports automatic retry for rate limits and failures:

```dart
final agent = Agent('openai');
final result = await agent.send('Hello!'); // Automatically retries on 429
```

### Agent&lt;TOutput&gt;(outputSchema) => sendForXxx&lt;TOutput&gt;(outputSchema)

Instead of putting the output schema on the `Agent` class, it's now on the
`sendForXxx` method:

```dart
// OLD
final agent = Agent<Map<String, dynamic>>('openai', outputSchema: ...);
final result = await agent.send('Hello');

// NEW
final agent = Agent('openai');
final result = await agent.sendFor<Map<String, dynamic>>('Hello', outputSchema: ...);
```

This allows you to be more flexible from message to message.

### `AgentResponse` to `ChatResult<MyType>`

The `AgentResponse` type has been renamed to `ChatResult`.

### DotPrompt Support Removed

The dependency on [the dotprompt_dart
package](https://pub.dev/packages/dotprompt_dart) has been removed from
dartantic_ai. However, you can still use the `DotPrompt` class to parse
`.prompt` files:

```dart
import 'package:dotprompt_dart/dotprompt_dart.dart';

final dotPrompt = DotPrompt(...);
final prompt = dotPrompt.render();
final agent = Agent(dotPrompt.frontMatter.model!);
await agent.send(prompt);
```

### Tool Calls with Typed Output

The `Agent.sendForXxx` method now supports specifying the output type of the
tool call:

```dart
final provider = Agent.createProvider('openai');
assert(provider.caps.contains(ProviderCaps.typedOutputWithTools));

// tools
final agent = Agent.forProvider(
  provider,
  tools: [currentDateTimeTool, temperatureTool, recipeLookupTool],
);

// typed output
final result = await agent.sendFor<TimeAndTemperature>(
  'What is the time and temperature in Portland, OR?',
  outputSchema: TimeAndTemperature.schema,
  outputFromJson: TimeAndTemperature.fromJson,
);

// magic!
print('time: ${result.output.time}');
print('temperature: ${result.output.temperature}');
```

Unfortunately, not all providers support this feature. You can check the
provider's capabilities to see if it does.

### ChatMessage Part Helpers

The `ChatMessage` class has been enhanced with helpers for extracting specific
types of parts from a list:

```dart
final message = ChatMessage.system('You are a helpful assistant.');
final text = message.text; // "You are a helpful assistant."
final toolCalls = message.toolCalls; // []
final toolResults = message.toolResults; // []
```

### Usage Tracking

The agent now supports usage tracking:

```dart
final result = await agent.send('Hello');
print('Tokens used: ${result.usage.totalTokens}');
```

### Logging

The agent now supports logging:

```dart
Agent.loggingOptions = const LoggingOptions(level: LogLevel.ALL);
```

## 0.9.7

- Added the ability to set embedding dimensionality
- Removed ToolCallingMode and singleStep mode. Multi-step tool calling is now
  always enabled.
- Enabled support for web and wasm.
- Breaking Change: Replaced `DataPart.file` with `DataPart.stream` for file and
  image attachments. This improves web and WASM compatibility. Use
  `DataPart.stream(file.openRead(), name: file.path)` instead of
  `DataPart.file(File(...))`.

## 0.9.6

- fixed an issue where the OpenAI model only processed the last tool result when
  multiple tool results existed in a single message, causing unmatched tool call
  IDs during provider switching.

## 0.9.5

- Major OpenAI Multi-Step Tool Calling Improvement: Eliminated complex probe
  mechanism (100+ lines of code) in favor of [OpenAI's native
  `parallelToolCalls`
  parameter](https://pub.dev/documentation/openai_dart/latest/openai_dart/CreateChatCompletionRequest/parallelToolCalls.html).
  This dramatically simplifies the implementation while improving reliability
  and performance.

## 0.9.4

- README & docs tweaks

## 0.9.3

- Completely revamped docs! https://docs.page/csells/dartantic_ai

## 0.9.2

- Added `Agent.environment` to allow setting environment variables
  programmatically. This is especially useful for web applications where
  traditional environment variables are not available.

## 0.9.1

- Added support for extending the provider table at runtime, allowing custom
  providers to be registered dynamically.

- Added optional `name` parameter to `DataPart` and `LinkPart` for better
  multi-media message creation ergonomics.

## 0.9.0

- Added `ToolCallingMode` to control multi-step tool calling behavior.
  - `multiStep` (default): The agent will continue to send tool results until
    all of the tool calls have been exercised.
  - `singleStep`: The agent will perform only one request-response and then
    stop.

- OpenAI Multi-Step Tool Calling by including probing for additional tool calls
  when the model responds with text instead of a tool call.

- Gemini multi-step tool calling by handling new tool calls while processing the
  response from previous tool calling.

- Schema Nullable Properties Fix: Required properties in JSON schemas now
  correctly set `nullable: false` in converted Gemini schemas, since required
  properties cannot be null by definition.

## 0.8.3

- Breaking Change: `McpServer` → `McpClient`: Renamed MCP integration class cuz
  we're not building a server!
- MCP Required Fields Preservation: Enhanced MCP integration to preserve
  required fields in tool schemas, allowing LLMs to know what parameters are
  required for each tool call. This turns out to be a critical piece in whether
  the LLM is able to call the tool correctly or not.
- Model discovery: Added `Provider.listModels()` to enumerate available models,
  and the kinds of operations they support and whether they're in stable or
  preview/experimental mode.
- Breaking Change: simplifying provider names (again!)
- no change to actual provider aliases, e.g. "gemini" still maps to "google"
- fixed a nasty fully-qualified model naming bug
- Better docs!

## 0.8.2

- Better docs!

## 0.8.1

- Breaking change: Content=>List<Part>, lots more List<> => Iterable<>

## 0.8.0

- Multimedia Input Support: Added `attachments` parameter to Agent and Model
  interfaces for including files, data and links.
- Improved OpenAI compatibility for tool calls
- Added the 'gemini-compat' provider for access to Gemini models via the OpenAI
  endpoint.
- Breaking change: everywhere I passed List<Message> I now pass
  Iterable<Message>

## 0.7.0

- Provider Capabilities System: Add support for providers to declare their
  capabilities
- baseUrl support to enable OpenAI-compatibility
- Added new "openrouter" provider
  - it's an OpenAI API implementation, but doesn't support embeddings
  - which drove support for provider capabilities...
- temperature support
- Breaking change: `McpServer.remote` now takes a `Uri` instead of a `String`
  for the URL
- Breaking change: Renamed model interface properties for clarity:
  - `Model.modelName` → `Model.generativeModelName`
  - Also added `Model.embeddingModelName`
- Breaking change: Provider capabilities API naming:
  - `Provider.caps` returns `Set<ProviderCaps>` instead of
    `Iterable<ProviderCaps>`

## 0.6.0

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Support
- Message construction convenience methods:
  - Added `Content` type alias for `List<Part>` to improve readability
  - Added convenience constructors for `Message`: `Message.system()`,
    `Message.user()`, `Message.model()`
  - Added `Content.text()` extension method for easy text content creation
  - Added convenience constructors for `ToolPart`: `ToolPart.call()` and
    `ToolPart.result()`
- Breaking change: inputType/outputType to inputSchema/outputSchema; I couldn't
  stand to look at `inputType` and `outputType` in the code anymore!
- Add logging support (defaults to off) and a logging example

## 0.5.0

- Embedding generation: Add methods to generate vector embeddings for text

## 0.4.0

- Streaming responses via `Agent.runStream` and related methods.
- Multi-turn chat support
- Provider switching: seamlessly alternate between multiple providers in a
  single conversation, with full context and tool call/result compatibility.

## 0.3.0

- added [dotprompt_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/dotprompt_dart) package
  support via `Agent.runPrompt(DotPrompt prompt)`
- expanded model naming to include "providerName", "providerName:model" or
  "providerName/model", e.g. "openai" or "googleai/gemini-2.0-flash"
- move types specified by `Map<String, dynamic>` to a `JsonSchema` object; added
  `toMap()` extension method to `JsonSchema` and `toSchema` to `Map<String,
dynamic>` to make going back and forth more convenient.
- move the provider argument to `Agent.provider` as the most flexible case, but
  also the less common one. `Agent()` will contine to take a model string.

## 0.2.0

- Define tools and their inputs/outputs easily
- Automatically generate LLM-specific tool/output schemas
- Allow for a model descriptor string that just contains a family name so that
  the provider can choose the default model.

## 0.1.0

- Multi-Model Support (just Gemini and OpenAI models so far)
- Create agents from model strings (e.g. `openai:gpt-4o`) or typed providers
  (e.g. `GoogleProvider()`)
- Automatically check environment for API key if none is provided (not web
  compatible)
- String output via `Agent.run`
- Typed output via `Agent.runFor`

## 0.0.1

- Initial version.
